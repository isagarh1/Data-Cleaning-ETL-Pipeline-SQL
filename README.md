## Project Title: Data Cleaning and ETL Pipeline

ğŸ“Œ Project Overview :

**This project demonstrates a SQL-based ETL pipeline using the Medallion Architecture (Bronze â†’ Silver â†’ Gold layers)**.

**The objective is to extract raw data, clean/transform it, and prepare business-ready datasets for analytics and reporting**.

- Bronze Layer: Stores raw ingested data from multiple sources (CRM & ERP).

- Silver Layer: Cleans and standardizes the data (handling nulls, data types, business rules).

- Gold Layer: Creates final aggregated and business-ready views for reporting and analytics.

ğŸ”¹ **Bronze Layer** :

- Stores raw data from CRM and ERP systems.

- No transformations applied.

- Tables created

**Before loading data into the Silver Layer, multiple quality checks are performed to ensure accuracy, consistency, and standardization**.

**Data Quality Checks**

âœ… Checks Performed

- Null & Duplicate Detection

        Ensures primary keys (like cst_id, prd_id) are unique and not null.
        
        Unwanted Spaces & Case Standardization
        
        Trimmed text fields (gender, marital_status, country).

- Data Standardization

        Replaced codes with meaningful values (M â†’ Male, S â†’ Single).
        
        Invalid or Missing Values
        
        Checked for negative/NULL product costs.

Recalculated sales if sales â‰  quantity Ã— price.

- Date Validations
        
        Ensured no invalid future birthdates (bdate > current_date).
        
        Checked product date ranges (end_date < start_date).
        
        Low Cardinality Consistency
        
        Verified small categorical fields (gender, marital status, country) have standardized values.

ğŸ”¹ **Silver Layer** :

- Data cleaning & transformation applied

- Standardized column names.

- Data type corrections.

- Null/duplicate handling.

ğŸ”¹ **Gold Layer** :

- Final business-ready datasets.

- Created using SQL Views (aggregations, KPIs, joins across CRM & ERP).

- Used for reporting in BI tools (Power BI / Tableau).
